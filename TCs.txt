I've provided the AlphaMind Project along with its test cases in a zip file. Your task is to:

Review the existing tests for the web frontend, backend, and mobile frontend.

Fix any errors you find in the test cases.

Improve the tests where necessaryâ€”optimize or refactor them as needed.

Add new test cases if any parts of the project are missing coverage.

Organize the test files correctly in their respective directories within the project structure.

Finally, return a zip file of the complete project, including the updated and organized test cases for all parts.







I've provided my project in a zip file. Your task is to:

Write test cases for all parts of the project (backend, frontend, etc.).

Ensure the tests are well-structured and comprehensive, covering key functionality.

After writing the tests, package only the newly created test directory in a zip file and send it back.
