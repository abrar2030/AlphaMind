# AlphaMind Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

AlphaMind is built using a modern microservices architecture with the following components:

### Frontend
- Built with React.js
- Uses modern state management
- Implements responsive design principles
- Communicates with backend via RESTful API

### Backend
- Python-based server
- RESTful API endpoints
- Database integration
- Authentication and authorization
- Business logic implementation

### Infrastructure
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Monitoring and logging
- Scalability considerations

## Component Interaction

```

```

## Data Flow

1. User interactions trigger frontend events
2. Frontend makes API calls to backend
3. Backend processes requests and interacts with database
4. Response is sent back to frontend
5. Frontend updates UI based on response

## Security Architecture

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- HTTPS encryption
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling support
- Load balancing
- Caching strategies
- Database optimization
- Microservices architecture

## Monitoring and Logging

- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- User activity logging
- System health metrics
- Alerting system

## Development Environment

- Local development setup
- Testing infrastructure
- Code quality tools
- Version control workflow
- Documentation standards
